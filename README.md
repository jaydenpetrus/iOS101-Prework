# Prework - My Coolest New App*

Submitted by: **Jayden Petrus**

**My Coolest New App** is an app that revolutionizes iOS development by changing the background color by the press of the "To Click or Not to Click ðŸ¤”" button close to the bottom of the screen. It incorporates a few labels and button as well as function to change the colors. I have improved this app by adding some fun fonts to the labels previously created.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button 
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Favorite Apps:**

Duolingo
- Vibrant use of color as well as usage of notifications for motivation
- Very simple to use UI, a person can figure out their way around the app seamlessly

Spotify
- Always able to give fresh recommendations and easy on the eyes
- Ability to access it easily from Macbook, iPhone, or iPad. 
- Useful widgets to jump right back into the app easily

Bible App
- Constantly updating with new information/verse to read into.
- The application is not overwhelming to look at even though there are so many things to do


**App Idea: Strengthy: Workout Optimizer**

I want to build an app that allows me to put in my workout for a specific day, then based on the body goals and diet that I have previously put in and are stored within the app, it will be able to give guidance on how to optimize my workout in the best way to reach my goals. This app will give users an accurate idea of whether their current training is sufficient and a few guidance points on how to improve it so that they are doing what is best for their current situation and not wasting any time in the gym.  


## Notes

The biggest challenge that I faced was just trying to get adjusted to all of the different options and things within the IDE. It was a little overwhelming at first, but after playing around, I was quickly acclimated.
